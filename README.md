# SASS-Signup_page
This is a signup page built with SASS, HTML and Javascript. It uses HTML validations as well as javascript interactions. This is a project built during my time at the DCTP handled by Alt School and Dev Career.

You can use and modify this project at your will but do give me credit. I'll be adding edits as I get more knowledge about sass. Thank you.
